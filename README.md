# socialmediaprofile

This is a rudimentary social media user profile design for Daily UI #6. The app name is titled Forum Ipsum and it would be an app for programmers, artists, et cetera. 
Specific elements include: 
a profile picture, a brief bio, a view resume button, a box beneath the profile image for submitting messages,
and a large section on the right that would act as an active element for viewing/scrolling through art, github, music, et cetera.
